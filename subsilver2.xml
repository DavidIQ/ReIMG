		<title lang="en-gb">ReIMG Image Resizer</title>
		
		<description lang="en-gb">Resizes user-posted images, including or excluding signatures, that are too large, optionally overlaying a zoom button to view the original-sized image (optionally in a lightbox or even using Highslide JS).</description>
		
		<author-notes lang="en-gb"><![CDATA[This MOD depends on client-side javascript support. However, it will not break without javascript, there will simply be less functionality (i.e. too large images will not be resized after all).
		
This MOD has been tested successfully with the following browsers:

* Internet Explorer 6, 7, 8
* Firefox 1.0, 1.5, 2, 3, 3.5
* Opera 9.27, 9.5, 9.6
* Safari 3.1, 4
* Mozilla 1.7
* Google Chrome 2.0.172.37
* Konqueror 4.2.2
* Epiphany 2.26.3

Since this MOD was not designed for any of these browsers specifically, any other W3C (semi-)compliant browser should also work.

This MOD uses HTML attributes (onload and onerror) that are not part of the XHTML 1.0 Strict and Transitional specifications. This is not a problem in virtually all popular browser software, but if you really need to stay 100% XHTML 1.0 compliant, then you could leave out the onload and onerror attributes. The drawback of this is that all images are shown at once, but only after the full document (including *all* images) has loaded. The user will probably experience this as being slower, because he will not see the images loading. One way of solving this is to show thumbnails of the images while loading them by adding this rule to your theme's style sheet:

.reimg { width: 10%; height: auto; visibility: visible; }

Included with this MOD are two versions of the reimg.js and litebox.js javascript files:

1. In root/reimg/ you will find the compressed versions, which are smaller in file size and will download more quickly. (For more information visit http://javascriptcompressor.com/.)
2. In contrib/js_original/ you will find the original javascript files with reasonably documented source code, which is more easily hackable/editable.

By default the compressed versions are installed to optimize for speed.

To change settings go to ACP -> Post Settings -> Image Resize Settings (at the bottom of the page).
Please note that if you plan on using Highslide JS you must follow the instructions shown next to the Zooming Method drop-down.]]></author-notes>

If this new zooming method ("external link") is selected and the user has chosen to open external links in a new window, then the images is  also opened in a new window, else the image is opened in the current window.</change>

				<rev-version>0.0.A7</rev-version>
				<changelog lang="en-gb">
					<change>Added support for right-to-left languages (although such languages are not included with this MOD). This also means that in "normal" (left-to-right) mode the zoom out button in the lightbox has been relocated from the right to the left corner (which probably is more consistant anyway). Unfortunately Safari and Opera currently do not position all zoom in and out buttons on the right side when in right-to-left mode, but everything still works. I am kind of hoping that these issues will be addressed in future releases of  Safari and Opera...</change>
					<change>The lightbox now gives users the choice to zoom in all the way, and so view the image 1:1 from within the lightbox (as suggested by "Squid Nunc?"). To control this feature two extra lightbox zooming methods have been added: "Lightbox 1:1" and "Lightbox resized".</change>
					<change>Removed the border around the zoom button on image attachments.</change>
					<change>If the zoom in and out button images are not available (e.g. because you have forgotten to refresh the imageset after installing this MOD), then green and red rectangles are displayed instead.</change>

					<change>Fixated the lightbox, so it does not scroll with the rest of the page. This does not work in Internet Explorer 6, in which the lightbox does still scroll with the rest of the page.</change>
					<change>Fixated the zoom out button in the lightbox when zoomed in 1:1, so it will not scroll out of sight. This feature is only supported by really modern browsers (Internet Explorer 7, Firefox 3 and Opera 9.5), in older browsers the zoom out button does still scroll out of sight.</change>
					<change>The lightbox now remembers what mode it was in (resized or 1:1) after resizing the browser window.</change>
					<change>Fixed a bug that caused the lightbox to be wrongly repositioned when the page behind it is still loading.</change>
					<change>The lightbox no longer grows to wide when zoomed in 1:1 in Internet Explorer 6.</change>
					<change>Added Opera 9.5 and updated Firefox 3 (to RC 3) in the list of tested browsers.</change>

					<change>Fixed a bug that caused images that were already resized (e.g. with style sheeting rules) to revert to their real size.</change>
					<change>Images are now hidden while they are being resized. This shouldn't matter as images aren't supposed to be rendered on screen until after they have been resized, but this will possibly (hopefully) resolve an issue with Firefox 2 and slower loading boards and/or images (issue reported by kipin and sam_xp).</change>
					<change>Disabled the zoom button in the topic view in the Moderator Control Panel.</change>
